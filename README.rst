Publishing sphinx-generated docs on github
------------------------------------------
github allows the publishing of static pages associated with a particular
repository (called project pages), which you can read more about at
http://pages.github.com/,

I frequently use Sphinx (http://sphinx.pocoo.org/) for documenting
projects, and would like to have my docs for a repo published to the
gh-pages for that repo.

This strategy uses ideas from
http://lucasbardella.com/report/hosting-your-sphinx-docs-in-github/, which
uses a separate directory for docs and keeps the autogenerated stuff out of
the main repo.  This in contrast to suggestions on
http://pages.github.com/, which does stuff within the repo directory.
Using a separate docs dir made things easier for me to figure out and
configure easier with the Sphinx makefile.

See http://daler.github.com/sphinxdoc-test for the Sphinx-generated version of
this README, created using the commands documented in it...


Protocol
--------

Set up main repository
++++++++++++++++++++++
First set up your main repo.  These are the commands I used to set up this
very repo (how meta!)::

    mkdir sphinxdoc-test
    cd sphinxdoc-test
    git init
    touch README
    git add README
    git commit -m 'first commit'
    git remote add origin git@github.com:daler/sphinxdoc-test.git
    git push origin master
